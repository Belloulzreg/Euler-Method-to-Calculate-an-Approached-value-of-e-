# Euler's Method to Calculate an Approached value of e
##Euler's Method:
let \[y' = f(x_k, y_k)\] be a first order OED defined in the interval [a, b], the numerical solutio of this type of equations is given by:
\[y_{k+1}=y_k + h f(x_k, y_k)\] for \[y(x_0)=y_0]\ where h represents the step.
In order to calculate the value of "e" we sove this OED:
y'-y = 1 for y(0)=1, the precision of our solution depends on how small the step h is, the smaller the better.
